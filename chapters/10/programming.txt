I love programming.
I love creating new games.
I also love finding meaning in large datasets.
I love creating apps that can run in a browser.
I love solving problems.
It feels cool to make a computer do what you want.
I don't have to talk to anyone.
There's so much to learn!
It forces you to really use your brain...all the time!
