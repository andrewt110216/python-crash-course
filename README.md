This repo includes the files I created while working through this textbook, organized by chapter, including
chapter exercises and any required data files, code samples from the readings, and other practice files.

I highly recommend this textbook to anyone who is beginning their programming journey with Python. While I
had years of experience programming with VBA, this was one of the first resources I used as I prepared for
a career transition from financial planning to software engineering, using Python as my primary language for learning.

Not only did it provide me with fairly comprehensive and interactive overview of the basic syntax and features
of python, but it covered many practical topics and use cases, including reading and writing date to file, JSON,
interacting with API's, data visualization libaries like plotly and matplotlib, creating and managing web
applications using Django and Heroku, and much more.
